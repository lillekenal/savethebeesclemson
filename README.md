Do you like plants? I know bees do! Help save the bees! 

These "bee bombs" do not hurt bees, but help them make pollinate flowers and make honey.

Please do not use pesticides on any of your plants; this kills the bees, and doesn't really help much.  My plants are growing great without pesticides.
